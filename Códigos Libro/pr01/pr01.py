# ## Package version checks

# Add folder to path in order to load from the check_packages.py script:



sys.path.insert(0, '..')


# Check recommended package versions:



d = {
    'numpy': '1.21.2',
    'mlxtend': '0.19.0',
    'matplotlib': '3.4.3',
    'sklearn': '1.0',
    'pandas': '1.3.2',
}
check_packages(d)
