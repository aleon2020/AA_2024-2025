# Add folder to path in order to load from the check_packages.py script:



# * import sys
# Import the sys module, which is a Python standard library module.
# This module provides access to variables and functions that interact strongly with the
# Python interpreter, such as manipulating module search path and input/output
# standard, among others.
# * sys.path
# It is a list containing the paths in which the Python interpreter looks for modules when
# you use import. When you try to import a module, Python searches the paths specified in this
# list.
# * sys.path.insert(0, '..')
# Insert the path '..' (representing the parent directory) at the beginning of the sys.path list.
# Adding it in position 0 ensures that when Python looks for modules to import,
# first check in the parent directory before continuing with the default paths.

sys.path.insert(0, '..')


# Check recommended package versions:



# Import the check_packages function from the python_environment_check module. 
# This module, from its name, appears to be designed to verify that the Python environment 
# have the correct versions of certain packages installed.
# * d = {...}
# Defines a dictionary d that contains the names of several packages as keys 
# (e.g. numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.) and as values ​​the minimum versions 
# required from those packages.
# * check_packages(d)
# The check_packages function takes as input the dictionary d and probably performs a 
# check on current Python environment to ensure installed versions 
# of these packages are at least those specified in the dictionary. If any of the packages 
# is not installed or has the wrong version, the function may throw an error or 
# suggest installing/updating the packages.

d = {
    'numpy': '1.21.2',
    'matplotlib': '3.4.3',
    'sklearn': '1.0',
    'pandas': '1.3.2'
}
check_packages(d)

# * from IPython.display
# Import from the display submodule of the IPython package. This module is designed to display 
# and render different types of data within interactive environments, such as Jupyter Notebooks.
# * import Image
# Import the Image class from the display module. The Image class is used to display 
# images in the interactive environment (for example, in a Jupyter Notebook cell).
# * %matplotlib inline
# This is a magic command specific to IPython/Jupyter Notebook.
# Enables display of matplotlib plots directly within cells of the 
# notebook. Graphics are rendered "inline" (within the same notebook) without the need 
# to open pop-up windows.

# Readers may ignore the next cell.



# Run a command in the terminal from a Python environment (such as a Jupyter Notebook or a 
# script that allows system commands to convert a Jupyter notebook to a file Python script. 
# * !
# This symbol is used in environments such as Jupyter Notebooks to execute system commands 
# operational directly from the notebook. In this case, the command is an execution of a 
# python script.
# * python ../.convert_notebook_to_script.py
# This command runs a Python script called convert_notebook_to_script.py. This file 
# is located in the previous directory (../ indicates that it is one level up in the system 
# files). The purpose of this script is to convert a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) into a 
# Python script file (.py).
# * --input ex05.ipynb
# This is an option or argument that tells the script what the input file is, in this 
# case, the notebook ex05.ipynb.
# * --output ex05.py
# This option tells the script to save the output (the converted file) with the name
# ex05.py, which is a Python script.
